# AI Chat Mod

## Overview
**AI Chat** is a lightweight Minecraft mod that integrates an AI assistant directly into your game using the `/aichat` command. Players can ask questions, get creative suggestions, or have dynamic conversations with an AI powered by [Pollinations.AI](https://pollinations.ai/). All responses appear in-game with native Minecraft chat formatting.

Currently, chat context is not supported.


## Key Features
- **In-Game AI Chat**  
  Use `/aichat <your message>` or `/aichat <seed> <your message>` to converse with the AI. Example:  
  `/aichat How do I find diamonds faster in Minecraft?`<br/>
  `/aichat 4999 什么是AI？`
  
- **Multi-Language Support**  
  Automatically responds in the **same language** as the user's input.

- **Async Network Handling**  
  Non-blocking HTTP requests ensure smooth gameplay without lag.

- **Error Resilience**  
  Gracefully handles API failures with localized error messages.

- **Markdown Format**  
  Markdown format output is supported.

You can use this command to create other mods and datapacks.
